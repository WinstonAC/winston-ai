## Overview

This document outlines the deployment process for Winston AI across different environments. The deployment configuration is managed through `deploy.config.js`, which contains environment-specific settings and deployment strategies.

## Environments

### Development
- **Purpose**: Local development and testing
- **Domain**: `localhost:3000`
- **Database**: Development database with minimal connection pool
- **Security**: No SSL, relaxed rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Debug-level logging
- **Cache**: Memory-based, short TTL

### Staging
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **Domain**: `staging.winston-ai.com`
- **Database**: Staging database with moderate connection pool
- **Security**: SSL enabled, standard rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Info-level logging
- **Cache**: Redis-based, moderate TTL

### Production
- **Purpose**: Live environment
- **Domain**: `app.winston-ai.com`
- **Database**: Production database with large connection pool
- **Security**: SSL enabled, strict rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Warn-level logging
- **Cache**: Redis-based, long TTL

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment (Staging)
1. Deploy new version to inactive environment
2. Run health checks
3. Switch traffic if health checks pass
4. Monitor for issues
5. Rollback if necessary

### Canary Deployment (Production)
1. Deploy to small percentage of users (10%)
2. Monitor metrics for 1 hour:
   - Error rate (< 1%)
   - Response time (< 1000ms)
   - CPU usage (< 80%)
3. Gradually increase to 100% if metrics are good
4. Rollback if metrics exceed thresholds

## Health Checks

### Database
- Query: `SELECT 1`
- Interval: 30 seconds
- Timeout: 5 seconds

### System Resources
- Memory: Check every 60 seconds, threshold 90%
- CPU: Check every 60 seconds, threshold 80%
- Disk: Check every 5 minutes, threshold 90%
- Network: Check every 30 seconds, timeout 5 seconds

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback
- Triggered when:
  - Error rate exceeds threshold (5% staging, 1% production)
  - Health checks fail consecutively
  - System metrics exceed thresholds

### Manual Rollback
1. Identify the last stable version
2. Stop current deployment
3. Revert to previous version
4. Verify system health
5. Notify stakeholders

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Metrics to Monitor
- Application performance
- Error rates
- System resources
- Database health
- Cache hit rates
- API response times

### Alert Thresholds
- Error rate: > 1%
- Response time: > 1000ms
- CPU usage: > 80%
- Memory usage: > 90%
- Disk usage: > 90%

## Best Practices

### Pre-Deployment
1. Run all tests
2. Check dependency updates
3. Verify environment variables
4. Review security configurations
5. Backup databases

### During Deployment
1. Monitor deployment logs
2. Watch health checks
3. Track performance metrics
4. Be ready to rollback
5. Keep stakeholders informed

### Post-Deployment
1. Verify all services
2. Check monitoring dashboards
3. Validate user functionality
4. Review error logs
5. Document the deployment

### Security Considerations
1. Use environment-specific secrets
2. Enable SSL in production
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Monitor for security issues
5. Keep dependencies updated

### Performance Optimization
1. Use appropriate cache settings
2. Configure connection pools
3. Monitor resource usage
4. Optimize database queries
5. Implement CDN where needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Database connection failures
2. High resource usage
3. Slow response times
4. Cache misses
5. SSL certificate issues

### Resolution Steps
1. Check deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Monitor system metrics
4. Review application logs
5. Check network connectivity
